# Machine Learning Project using DVC Pipeline
### Machine Learning projects consist of multiple stages:
+ Data Preprocessing
+ Feature Extraction
+ Training
+ Evaluation
...
- DVC pipelines simplify the execution of stages in an ML pipeline. If a change is made in one stage, such as feature extraction, the pipeline runs only the affected stage and skips all others, ultimately saving time in the overall execution
