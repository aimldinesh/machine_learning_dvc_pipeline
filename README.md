# Machine Learning Project using DVC Pipeline
### Machine Learning projects consist of multiple stages:
+ Data Preprocessing
+ Feature Extraction
+ Training
+ Evaluation
...
### DVC pipelines make it easy to execute stages of an ML pipeline. If we make a change in one stage (such as feature extraction), it runs only the feature extraction stage and skips all the other stages.
